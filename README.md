##Maglev

####Introduction

Maglev is a basic framework that allows users to construct an RESTful
web application. Rack allows Maglev to manipulate the response and requests
that are communicated between the Puma server and the user's client/browser.
Maglev allows users to create classes for application logic, controllers for
routing logic, and views for presentation structure. This is not connected 
to an ORM in order to persist data.















<!-- ####Introduction

Maglev is a light-weight framework that gives applications the ability to
communicate with a client browser using the HTTP request-response cycle.

####Technologies

- Ruby- Maglev is written using Ruby
- Rack- Serves as the server interface for Maglev

####Future Direction

- Merge with an ORM lite project.
If I make a lite version of ActiveRecord, the data that is used in the applications
on maglev can persist using a database.

- Implement rails new
I plan to give users easy access to the framework by running rails new which sets up
the basics of the application for them. -->
