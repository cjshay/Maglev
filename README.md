##Maglev

####Introduction

Maglev is a light-weight MVC framework that lets applications to communicate
with a client browser using the HTTP request-response cycle.

####Technologies

- Ruby- Maglev is written using Ruby
- Rack- Serves as the server for Maglev

####Future Direction

Rails is a very complex framework and fun to interact with, so I plan to keep working
on this project.

- Merge with an ORM lite project.
If I make a lite version of ActiveRecord, the data that is used in the applications
on maglev can persist using a database.

- Implement rails new
I plan to give users easy access to the framework by running rails new which sets up
the basics of the application for them.
